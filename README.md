# EEG Emotion Analysis with Wavelet Transformation and Machine Learning
This project aims to analyze EEG (electroencephalogram) signals using wavelet transformation and machine learning techniques to predict emotions based on the EEG data. The project consists of two main components: signal processing and machine learning.

In the signal processing component, the EEG signals are first preprocessed and then transformed using wavelet transformation. Wavelet transformation is a powerful technique for signal analysis that can extract both frequency and time information from signals. By applying wavelet transformation to EEG signals, we can obtain a more comprehensive representation of the signals and extract relevant features for emotion classification.

In the machine learning component, we will use the extracted features to train a classification model that can predict emotions based on the EEG data. We will explore various machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVM), random forests, and deep neural networks, to find the most suitable model for this task.

This project is intended for researchers and developers interested in exploring EEG signal processing and machine learning techniques for emotion analysis. The code is written in Python, and we will use popular open-source libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, and scikit-learn. We hope this project will be a useful resource for those interested in this field, and we welcome contributions from the community.
